<p><strong>The Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 ASPH.: reimagined. For landscape photographers or those who work with close-range focus</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leica represents over a century of expert craftsmanship, design and experience, employing the beautiful union of art and engineering. The result? Impressive feats in the future of form and functionality – the Summilux, no exception. With light wide-angle and natural-looking dimensions, it boasts particularly versatile features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we know, wide angle lenses provide a greater depth of field than a telephoto lens, adding foreground interest to landscape photographs. The Summilux-M performs particularly well in difficult light conditions or shooting subjects in close range with selective focus. The updated design features eleven instead of nine aperture blades for revamped bokeh with the closest focusing distance reduced from 70 to 40 centimetres.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ingeniously engineered, patent-pending double-cam unit allows the rotation angle of the focus ring, almost doubling to 176° from the previous incarnation. Keeping the same compact size of the lens, it facilitates reliable, precise focusing over the entire setting range. Working via the rangefinder of all digital and analogue M cameras, up to 70cm. The extended close-up range between 70 and 40cm is exactly focusable via Live View on the screen, Visoflex viewfinder or Leica Fotos app.<img src="https://www.photographynews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11727_Summilux-M_35_f1_4_lens_silver_front_sRGB.png" alt=""></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why mess with perfection? The industrial design has been brought up to date with largely unchanged dimensions ­. The Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 ASPH. is two millimetres shorter, while two millimetres have been added to the diameter. Harking back to the Summilux-M 50 f/1.4 ASPH., the lens hood is now round, directly integrated in the lens and can easily be screwed or unscrewed at any time. This allows for lightning fast and flexible handling, while increasing the scope for snapping photos.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two colour variants of the Leica Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 ASPH. are available globally at all Leica Stores, the Leica Online Store and authorised dealers. The retail price of the black variant will be £4,950.00 including VAT and the retail price of the silver variant will be £5,100.00 including VAT.</p>
